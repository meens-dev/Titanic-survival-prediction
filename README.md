# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the famous Kaggle Titanic dataset. This project was created as part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, gender, class, fare, and more.

- **Files Used**:
  - `train.csv` – for training the model
  - `test.csv` – for evaluation/predictions

## 📈 Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Handled missing values (age, cabin, etc.)  
3. Converted categorical features into numerical form  
4. Performed exploratory data analysis (visualizations)  
5. Built models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
6. Compared model performances  
7. Generated predictions on test data

## 🧪 Sample Prediction Features

- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)  
- Sex  
- Age  
- Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard  
- Fare  
- Embarked Location  
- Alone or Not Alone

## 💡 Learnings

- Understood the complete data science workflow
- Practiced real-world data preprocessing techniques
- Gained experience in feature engineering and model building
- Learned to evaluate models and improve accuracy

---

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Use more advanced models like XGBoost or SVM  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  
- Improve feature selection and handling of outliers  
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
